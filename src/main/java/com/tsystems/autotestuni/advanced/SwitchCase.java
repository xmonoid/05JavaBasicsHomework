     * At our hotel, we have a reward card for frequent guests.
     * There are three card levels, namely gold (3), silver (2) and bronze (1), with bronze being the lowest level.
     *
     * The benefits of each of the levels is as follows:
     *  + bronze = free parking + newspaper
     *  + silver = bronze level features + breakfast
     *  + gold = silver level features + dinner for one
     *
     * If you do not have a reward card, then by default all you get is a room.
     *
     * Implement a method which on assessing an {@code int} variable that contains the card level,
     * prints out, using a switch block, all the benefits of each level.
     *
     * For example, {@code System.out.println("\t included dinner for one")}
     *
     * @param level guest level: 1 (bronze), 2 (silver), 3 (gold)
